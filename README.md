Work in progress to create a mapping tool to process files in bulk.  The tool find and replaces source values with target values and can consume an Excel based file to serve as a list of source and target values.  Mappings passed through Excel will be sorted from most exclusive to least.

The tool will also process values that have already been processed by a previous Source-Target match.  

Tool also is able to process zip files through unpacking, processing, archiving results and tidying up.  

Current iteration can cover the following file types:
<ul>
  <li> .txt </li>
  <li> .csv </li>
  <li> .xml </li>
  <li> .xlsx </li>
  <li> .xlsm </li>
</ul>
